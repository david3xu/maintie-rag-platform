# 🔗 Team Beta: Knowledge Graph Service Development
## Class/Function Level Implementation Todo List

**Service**: Knowledge Graph Service  
**Innovation Focus**: Domain knowledge representation and intelligent concept expansion  
**Team**: Beta  
**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 days for basic implementation  
**Status**: Ready for development

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

Team Beta develops the Knowledge Graph Service, the foundational intelligence layer that transforms MaintIE's expert annotations into an actionable knowledge network. This service provides the domain expertise that differentiates our RAG system from generic solutions. You will build the core graph infrastructure that enables intelligent concept expansion and relationship discovery across maintenance domains.

**Strategic Impact**: This service directly converts our 8,076 expert-annotated maintenance texts into structured knowledge, providing the competitive advantage that makes enhanced retrieval possible.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Knowledge graph construction from MaintIE datasets
- Concept expansion API for query enhancement
- Simple but effective graph traversal algorithms
- Data processing pipeline for maintenance knowledge
