# üåê Gateway Service: API Integration Development
## Class/Function Level Implementation Todo List

**Service**: API Gateway Service  
**Innovation Focus**: Service orchestration and external API integration  
**Team**: Integration Team (or shared responsibility)  
**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 days for basic implementation  
**Status**: Ready for development

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

The Gateway Service serves as the single entry point for our MaintIE-Enhanced RAG platform, orchestrating communication between all four core innovation services while providing a clean, unified API for external consumers. This service transforms the complexity of our multi-service architecture into a simple, reliable interface that delivers the full enhanced RAG experience through a single endpoint call.

**Strategic Impact**: The gateway enables seamless integration with existing maintenance systems while providing the abstraction layer that allows each innovation service to evolve independently. This service ensures our platform delivers enterprise-ready reliability while maintaining the architectural flexibility that supports rapid innovation.

**Key Functions**: Request routing, service orchestration, error handling, and performance monitoring across the entire platform pipeline.

**Expected Performance**: Sub-2 second end-to-end response times with 99%+ reliability, handling the complete query processing pipeline from raw user input to domain-enhanced responses.
